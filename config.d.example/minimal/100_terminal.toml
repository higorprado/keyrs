# Terminal Application Shortcuts
#
# Terminal apps use Ctrl+Shift for clipboard operations instead of Ctrl.
# This maps Cmd (Super) keys to the terminal equivalents.
#
# Condition matches common terminal emulators:
# - alacritty, kitty, wezterm, gnome-terminal, konsole, xfce4-terminal
# - ghostty, wave, terminology, deepin-terminal, contour, hyper
